    "# Week 1: Building Your RAG Evaluation Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating RAG systems is challenging, especially when you're just starting out. This notebook introduces a practical approach to assessment using synthetic data generation - a crucial first step before diving into more complex metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional RAG evaluation focuses on generated content quality, but this approach has significant drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Content Generation | Retrieval Metrics |\n",
    "|--------|-------------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| Speed | 1-10s per test | 10-800ms per test |\n",
    "| Cost | $100s per run | Negligible |\n",
    "| Objectivity | Subjective | Quantitative |\n",
    "| Iteration Speed | Hours | Minutes |\n",
    "| Scale | Limited | Automated |\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we'll focus on retrieval metrics that are:\n",
    "- Fast to compute (milliseconds vs seconds)\n",
    "- Objective and reproducible\n",
    "- Easy to automate\n",
    "- Cost-effective at scale\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this hands-on tutorial, you'll learn to build a comprehensive evaluation framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Synthetic Data Generation**\n",
    "   - Create diverse, realistic test questions\n",
    "   - Generate comprehensive datasets without real user data\n",
    "   - Learn techniques for systematic question generation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maintain Query Diversity**\n",
    "   - Identify different types of questions to test\n",
    "   - Cover various query patterns and edge cases\n",
    "   - Build representative test scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation Setup**\n",
    "   - Establish measurement foundations\n",
    "   - Set up automated testing pipelines\n",
    "   - Create reproducible evaluation workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a good understanding of what retrieval metrics are, how we can generate synthetic questions to benchmark our retrieval system and how we can use these questions to evaluate our retrieval system.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Evaluating Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "Before looking at our case study, let's first understand some of the metrics that we'll be using to evaluate our retrieval system. These metrics will form the basis of our evaluation framework throughout this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Retrieval Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** measures how many of our retrieved items are actually relevant:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Relevant Items Retrieved}}{\\text{Total Number of Retrieved Items}} $$\n",
    " \n",
    "For example, if your system retrieves 10 documents but only 5 are relevant, that's 50% precision. Low precision indicates your system is wasting resources processing irrelevant content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall** measures how many of the total relevant items we managed to find:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Relevant Items Retrieved}}{\\text{Total Number of Relevant Items}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are 20 relevant documents in your database but you only retrieve 10 of them, that's 50% recall. Low recall suggests you're missing important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we often measure these metrics at specific cutoff points (like top-5 or top-10 results), denoted as Precision@K or Recall@K. This reflects real-world usage where users typically only look at the first few results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an example where we're trying to build a Text-2-SQL application. This is an application where we take in a user query and output a SQL query which can be used to retrieve the relevant information as seen below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Text : Hey could you help me find the top 5 most popular items in our store?\n",
    "Query: SELECT item_name, COUNT(*) as popularity FROM items GROUP BY item_name ORDER BY popularity DESC LIMIT 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This feels like a generation task but ultimately can be greatly improved by including few-shot examples. This is very similar to how we might look for relevant text chunks in a classic Question Answer RAG application.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, by framing this as a retrieval task, we can start by looking at precision and recall of our retrieval system before we even start looking at the generated SQL queries. This has two main benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When we do evaluate the generated SQL queries, we can identify edge cases early on and add them to our list of snippets. We can then verify that these few shot examples are retrieved when we encounter these questions to help generate better SQL snippets.\n",
    "2. Different companies have unique business logic or calculation methods. Being able to retrieve the relevant snippets when these specific measurements are required is crucial. \n"

    "## Case Study : Bird-Bench\n",
    "\n",
    "For this case-study, we'll be using the Bird-Bench dataset. This is a huge Text-2-SQL dataset which contains a collection of text questions to a corresponding sql query. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the dev split of this dataset for this case study that provides ~1500+ sql snippets that involves ~95 different tables that we can use. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've cleaned the dataset ahead of time and uploaded it to `567-labs/bird-rag`. Each example in our dataset contains three things\n",
    "\n",
    "- `id` : This is a unique identifier for each query\n",
    "- `query` : This is a sample SQL query \n",
    "- `difficulty` : This is a label that indicates how difficult the query is to generate. It can be either `simple`, `moderate` or `challenging`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this case study, we'll only be using the `challenging` queries so that we can generate more difficult questions. This allows us to test our retrieval system under more demanding conditions, ensuring that it performs well even with complex queries\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, let's take a look at our dataset"

    "Looking ahead to Week 2, we'll leverage these concepts to fine-tune our retrieval models. Using both Cohere's managed re-ranker and the open-source BGE embedding model, we'll see how fine-tuning can improve our recall and MRR metrics on domain-specific queries. \n",
